    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Kate is an assassin and expert sniper who eliminates targets chosen by her trusted mentor and handler, Varrick. After she was left orphaned as a child, Varrick raised her as a father figure, giving her extensive training in weapons and combat and eventually inducting her into his private team of wetwork specialists.</p>

    <p>As the film opens, Kate is in Osaka to kill an officer of a powerful yakuza syndicate, readying herself with her rifle in a vantage point. The syndicate member steps out of his car and presents himself as a target, but Kate resists taking the shot because a child has unexpectedly accompanied him. She ultimately shoots the target at Varrick's insistence. While Kate's assignment is a success, this breach of her personal code to not kill in the presence of children leaves her in emotional turmoil. She tells Varrick that she will do one final mission, and then retire so she can start a new life.</p>
      
      <p></p>Before the final mission, Kate meets a charismatic stranger, Stephen, at her hotel's bar. The pair share a bottle of wine and have sex in her room. Later, while preparing her sniper's nest, she starts getting symptoms of dizziness that cause her to miss the shot. Kate realizes that Stephen poisoned her, and after crashing her car, wakes up in a hospital to learn that she has acute radiation poisoning caused by Polonium-204 and only twenty-four hours to live. She steals injectable stimulant drugs and a gun and sets out to exact revenge on whoever poisoned her.</p>
      
      <p></p>Kate tracks down Stephen and his girlfriend, and learns that they were strong-armed into poisoning her by Sato, a yakuza affiliated with the Kijima crime family. Kate finds Sato at a luxury restaurant and kills him along with dozens of armed yakuza. Desperate for information about the reclusive, well-guarded Boss Kijima, who she thinks might be behind the poisoning, she kidnaps Ani, Kijima's biracial niece. Kate realizes that Ani is the girl who saw her father die during the Osaka mission.</p>
      
      <p></p>While Kate initially only wants to use Ani as bait to lure Kijima out into the open, she decides to become her protector upon learning that Ani's family wants to kill her as part of an internal power struggle, led by Kijima's corrupt advisor, Renji. Kate uncovers more clues about the Osaka mission and realizes that her trust in Varrick may be misplaced after tracking down Kijima, who reveals that Renji made a deal with Varrick to incorporate his team into the syndicate in exchange for killing Kijima and all of his blood relatives. Kijima, aware that Kate is close to death, provides her with a small army of his men to assault Renji's headquarters.</p>
      
      <p>fter a fierce gunfight, all of Renji and Varrick's men are killed, and Kijima personally beheads Renji for his betrayal. Kate locates Varrick, who is holding Ani at gunpoint. The two have a fast draw and Varrick is fatally shot in the stomach. Ani then helps Kate walk outside to the roof, where Kate, finally at peace with herself, dies.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Why it is my favorite</h2>
    <p> Honestly, I liked the film a lot. Assassin characters, whether they be in video games, novels or movies are never my favorite type of character. They're pretty one-dimensional, emotionless stoic killing machines and they're all basically the same person, but writers love them because assassin characters are functional</p>

     <p id="2nd Movie">Extraction (2020)</p>
    <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\GitHub\Midterm\resources\images\extraction.jpg" alt="profile image width="150px" height="150px" align="left">
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>After a day at school, Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) - son of an incarcerated Indian drug lord - sneaks out of his house to visit a club, where he is kidnapped by police officers working for rival drug lord Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), a former Para (SF) operator and Ovi's protector, visits Ovi's father in prison. Unwilling to pay the ransom as it will hurt his prestige, Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi) orders Saju to retrieve his son, threatening Saju's own family.</p>

      <p></p>Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black-market mercenary and former SASR operator, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to rescue Ovi from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Rake rescues Ovi, kills his captors, and takes him to the extraction point, but his father's men intentionally fail to transfer the funds. Instead, Saju kills Rake's teammates to bring Ovi back himself to avoid any payment to the mercenary group. Learning of Ovi's escape, Asif orders an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges out of the city.</p>
      
      <p></p>Khan arranges for a helicopter to extract Rake outside the city and tells him to abandon Ovi as they will not get paid for Ovi's extraction contract. He refuses, haunted by memories of his own son, who died at a young age from lymphoma when he left. After escaping Saju and the corrupt police and tactical units, Rake fights off a gang of boys led by Farhad, a young criminal determined to impress Asif. Rake calls his friend Gaspar (David Harbour), a retired squad-mate living in Dhaka, and he and Ovi lay low at Gaspar's home. Gaspar reveals Asif has placed a $10 million bounty on Ovi, which he offers to share if Rake allows him to kill Ovi. Rake refuses and fights Gaspar, who gains the upper hand but is fatally shot by Ovi.</p>
      
      <p></p>Rake calls Saju and asks for his help, forcing them to team up to escape Dhaka. Rake draws attention away from a disguised Saju and Ovi as the two make their way through a bridge checkpoint, then follows to cover their escape. Khan and her remaining mercenaries approach from the opposite side of the bridge, as Asif watches from afar with binoculars. In the ensuing firefight, Saju is sniped by Asif's colonel Rashid, who is in turn sniped by Khan. Wounded, Rake instructs Ovi to run to Khan's waiting helicopter. As Rake follows, he is shot in the neck by Farhad and, seeing Ovi is safe, falls into the river. Ovi, Khan, and the extraction team escape to Mumbai.</p>
      
      <p></p>Eight months later, Khan kills Asif in a men's restroom. Ovi jumps into his school's swimming pool and surfaces to see a man watching him.</p>
      <h2>Why it is my favorite</h2>
      <p>Some of the most things l like about Extraction is that they have the actor Chris Hemsworth in it. I love how the story flows together and the battle scenes. There were some parts were serious and sad, but l didnâ€™t mind at all. It makes a great story how the character Tyler Rakes needs to save a boy named Ovi back to his original home in lndia. I like how they made Tyler a hero of saving Ovi throughout the movie. It was very well written and the actors did a good job making their character behavior.</p>

    <p id="3rd Movie"> Eli (2019)</a></p>
    <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\GitHub\Midterm\resources\images\eli.jpg" alt="profile image width="150px" height="150px" align="left">
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Eli is a young boy suffering from a rare disease that causes severe allergic reactions to the outdoors, forcing him to live his life in protective gear. His parents, Rose and Paul, have taken him to Dr. Isabella Horn's secluded medical facility, in a large, old house that has been modernized and hermetically quarantined. Eli is initially overjoyed that the facility allows him to remove his "bubble suit", embrace his parents, and enjoy comforts previously denied to him. His joy is short-lived, however, as he begins to experience supernatural phenomena in various parts of the house. He also begins his treatments, which are excruciatingly painful. As the supernatural encounters increase, the specters repeatedly leave him the message lie, and Eli wonders if the spirits are trying to warn him about Horn's treatments.</p>

      <p>Eli befriends Haley, a young girl with whom he speaks through a large window in the house's lower level. She is the only person who believes his claims that the house is haunted, as Horn has told his parents Eli's visions are hallucinations caused by the treatments. Haley also tells him none of the other patients Horn treated left the facility, implying that they died. With Haley's help, Eli manages to discover the word "lie" is actually the inverted number 317, the passcode to Horn's office. When he investigates the office, Eli finds Horn's records of past patients, showing that all of them were killed by the third, final treatment.</p>

      <p>Eli unsuccessfully tries to persuade his parents that the three of them should leave the facility. His father tricks him into a false state of security, then tries to drug him into unconsciousness. Hurt and confused, Eli runs away and barricades himself in Horn's office. He finds a photograph of Horn and her assistants dressed as nuns. He also finds a hidden passageway to an underground room with a circular stone monument and religious paraphernalia. When Horn discovers him there, she locks him in, and he experiences an allergic reaction and passes out. When he awakes, he finds he can breathe fine, and his disease was a lie. His mother, feeling guilty for deceiving Eli, comes to Eli in the hidden room, where he pretends he's still unconscious. When she opens the gate and approaches him, he knocks her unconscious with a heavy crucifix he has removed from the wall.</p>
      
      <p>Eli is recaptured by Horn and his father. Meanwhile, his mother regains consciousness and finds that the crucifix with which Eli struck her contains a dagger. She then discovers that the stone monument conceals the bodies of Horn's previous patients, bound and adorned with large religious symbols. Horrified and angry, she goes upstairs and uses the dagger to force her way into the treatment room. However, her husband tricks her into turning the knife over to him.</p>
      
      <p>It is then revealed that, rather than having a "disease", Eli is a child of Satan, and that his "allergic reactions" were manifestations of his emerging powers. Horn begins the third "treatment"-a religious ritual meant to end Eli's life. Horn throws holy water on Eli, temporarily disabling him, and tries to stab him with the sacrificial dagger. However, Eli summons his powers and uses telekinesis to lift Horn and her two assistants in the air. Eli causes them to spin around him, upside-down, then burst into flame. Their bodies drop to the floor and set the house afire. Eli's mother reveals that she wanted a son so badly, she turned to Satan, who lied that Eli would be a normal child. Eli's father advances with the sacrificial dagger, but Eli immobilizes him and kills him by crushing his face.</p>
      
      <p>Eli and his mother leave the burning house, where Haley greets them. She reveals that she too is a child of Satan, and that she was unable to save him, as he had to find and prove his own power. She offers to take Eli to his true father. When he accepts, Haley wonders if he can trust his mother. He indicates that he can, and the film ends with the mother driving the two children away from the burning facility. </p>

    <p id="4th Movie"> Old Guard(2019)</a></p>
    <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\GitHub\Midterm\resources\images\old guard.jpg" alt="profile image width="150px" height="150px" align="left">
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>From " The Movie Spoiler " page ( This spoiler was submitted by Jeremy )

      <p>The film starts with four people laying on the ground, riddled with bullets. We hear the voice of Andromache the Scythian/"Andy" (Charlize Theron) saying how tired she is of all this.</p> 
      
        <p>Sometime earlier, Andy meets with one of her partners, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) in Morocco. They join their other partners, Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli). The four of them are immortal assassins who have lived for centuries. They are so devoted to staying hidden that Andy must discreetly erase a picture that a group of women took that she is seen in. They are set to meet with an ex-CIA operative, James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who tasks them with catching a militia responsible for terrorizing locals with kidnapping and violence.</p> 
      
          <p>The team accepts the mission and is flown to South Sudan. As they gear up and enter the base, they quickly realize they were set up before the militia in question steps out to mow them all down with bullets, leading to the intro scene. The four lay bleeding until their powers allow them to push the bullets out and heal quickly. The militia is surprised but have little time to react further as the team starts killing them, with Andy wielding her axe against the mercs. They spot a camera and figure that Copley had set it up to expose their secret. Andy destroys the camera, and the four escape and resolve to stick together to find Copley.</p> 
      
            <p>In Afghanistan, a team of U.S. Marines head into a base to rescue women who are being held captive by a terrorist leader. Nile Freeman (Kiki Layne) leads the team in, and one of the women directs her to the target. Nile and her partners head in and shoot at the target. She tries to stop his bleeding to take him in alive, but he grabs a knife and slashes her throat. Nile's partner Dizzy (Natacha Karam) goes to tend to her wound as Nile appears to lose consciousness. As this happens, the four assassins experience the same vision of Nile together, realizing that there is another like them that is out there. They change course and head to find her. In the medic tent, Nile's neck wound has completely healed, to the surprise of Dizzy and the other Marines.</p> 
      
              <p>In London, Copley attends a presentation from his employer, Merrick (Harry Melling), who wants to have his company, Merrick Pharmaceuticals, potentially save millions of lives with their innovations. Copley shows Merrick the footage of the assassins after the mission, and while he is impressed, Merrick wants hard physical proof for his experiments.</p> 
      
                <p>Nile is alienated by her teammates after the incident, and she is told she is to be sent to Germany for more tests, despite her objections. Before she is taken, Andy intercepts her and knocks out the other soldiers before taking Nile with her. On the drive, Nile tries to escape, and Andy steps out to shoot her in the head. Up until this point, Nile thought she might have been dreaming, but she now realizes that she really cannot die. They make it to an airbase where a pilot takes them to France. After Andy falls asleep, she finds that Nile tied her arm to the plane and is trying to force her and the pilot at gunpoint to land the plane. Andy shoots the pilot and orders Nile to free her so that she can fly the plane, but it turns out to have just been a trick to get free, as the pilot was just playing dead. Andy subdues Nile and forces her to continue going along with their mission.</p> 
      
                  <p>Andy and Nile arrive at their hideout to meet the other guys. Nile is told what their team does and how their powers work, as well as the fact that they have lived through (and even been involved in) countless historical events. Andy explains that they can eventually die, but they never knew when it could happen or why/how it does, as they lost a fellow immortal warrior centuries earlier after his wounds never healed. At night, Nile wakes up startled after telling the guys she saw a vision of a woman trapped in an iron coffin, screaming and thrashing about. Booker tells her that the woman was a former partner of theirs, Quynh (Van Veronica Ngo), who was the first of the immortals that Andy found. They were great friends and partners until they were captured and continuously killed by people who thought they were inhuman. Quynh was forced into the iron coffin and thrown into the sea, where she remained trapped for 500 years, doomed to continue drowning with no chance of escape, and Nile was able to feel all of her pain.</p> 
      
                    <p>Later on, the hideout is attacked by some mercs working for Merrick. Booker is incapacitated with a grenade, and his wounds take longer to heal, while Joe and Nicky are captured. Andy finds some of the men and kills them before she escapes with Nile and Booker. She is wounded and finds that she is taking longer to heal.</p> 
      
                      <p>The mercs taunt Joe and Nicky as they try to separate them. When one of them mockingly asks Joe if Nicky is his boyfriend, he gives an impassioned speech about how Nicky is way more than that. They kiss before the goons pull them apart. They are taken to Merrick, where Joe headbutts him. He retaliates by trying to see proof of their immortality by repeatedly stabbing Joe. Merrick has Joe and Nicky taken to the lab while still demanding that the other immortals be found.</p> 
      
                        <p>Andy, Nile, and Booker stop at an abandoned mine where some of their belongings are. Andy fears that they may be tracked after she was wounded by one of the men back at the hideout. As they plan their next move, Nile continues to have questions about her newfound destiny. She is more reluctant to go along after Booker says that he has already outlived all of his children. Nile thinks about her own mother and brother, and how they had to mourn her father when he was killed in action. Andy goes to a nearby pharmacy to have her wound tended to. Later, as they proceed to carry on their mission, Nile decides to back out and spend whatever time she has left with her family, and Andy lets her go. However, Nile later finds a gun clip in the trunk of the car, realizing Booker intentionally gave Andy an empty gun.</p> 
      
                          <p>Andy and Booker track down Copley and move in to get him, but Booker reveals his alliance with Copley and shoots Andy in the back. He justifies his betrayal by saying that Merrick may have found a way to end their immortality so that they can die peacefully. Booker then notices that Andy is still not healing as quick as she was. Merrick has his men take her and Booker to join Joe and Nicky, fully intent on potentially killing them all if it means he has found his breakthrough. After Joe and Nicky find out about Booker's deception, they turn on him as well.</p> 
      
                            <p>Nile finds Copley and forces him to help her rescue the others, but he is more than willing after seeing what kind of man Merrick really is. Copley had been gathering information on the exploits and heroics that the immortals have performed throughout the centuries. They make it to Merrick's building and kill his men before freeing the immortals. Instead of leaving, Andy opts to stop Merrick then and there to prevent him from hunting them any further. After killing another slew of mercenaries, Merrick finds Andy and Nile. After he attacks, Andy jams her axe into his neck, and as he tries to shoot her, Nile tackles him out the window and they both land on a car. Nile heals up while Merrick is a dead bloody mess. The team then leaves together, and Andy's wounds eventually heal.</p> 
      
                              <p>Copley helps set up Nile's situation as being killed in action, meaning her family will have to mourn her as they did her father. Meanwhile, the other immortals force Booker into a century-long exile for his betrayal, and he bids them farewell. The others decide to continue working with Copley as long as he can help them stay hidden.</p> 
      
      Six months later, Booker drunkenly returns to his apartment in Paris. He is greeted by a very unexpected visitor: Quynh.</p>
      <h2>Why it is my favorite</h2>
      <p>I just loved the movie. It's an amazing movie with a nicely written plot. This movie is made for you if you are interested in actions, drama, emotions, and thriller. The star casts are apt and the story is fresh. There were a lot of scenes that will be left you awestruck. I also liked the past part.  The protagonist, Charlize Theron's acting and gestures were to the point.</p>

      <h2>Why it is my favorite</h2>
      <p>I found this movie very realistic and relatable especially with the pandemic we are living in now. The loss of family, depression, suicidal thoughts, complete isolation driving one crazy, shortage of food and value of each drop of water, the need for a human connection and the need to survive.</p>
